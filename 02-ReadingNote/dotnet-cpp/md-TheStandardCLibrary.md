![Book icon](http://fabiensanglard.net/c/c_standard_library.png)

The file is a notes for study **The C Standard library**. I feel use mardown to wirte note is very funning, and hope give me some pleasures. The C is a big problem computer language for me. In fact, the Python is my best love, it like Visual Basic. On the other side, the Python provide a simplest program style, and I very like List and for...each.

I feel C is very complex, very special for Pointer. But I want to write some linux application, that mean must learn it and must to be a great C program.

> **Introduce myself**

My english is very poor. But I try my best to study it. At least I can read computer scentists books and write a little notes by myself. So, you reading it now.
