* [Refernce URL](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/getting-started-elastic-stack)
* Target
  * Basic concepts of ElasticSearch
  * ElasticSearch APIs
  * Query DSL and mapping
  * Aggregations using ElasticSearch
  * ElasticSearch analyzers
  * Scripting in ElasticSearch

## Video 1 - Basic Concepts of Elasticsearch

* Video target
  * ElasticSearch terminology
  * Understanding ElasticSearch structure

* ElasticSearch Terminology
  * Cluster: 一群ES主机组成的集群
  * Nodes: ES集群中的一台ES主机
  * Index: 
  * Type
  * Document
  * Shards and Replicas

* Node
  * Master and Master Eligible node
  * Data node
  * Ingest node
  * Tribe node

## Video 2 - Elasticsearch APIs

* Target
  * An overview on ElasticSearch REST APIs
  * Hands on demonstration on using APIs with Console

* ElasticSearch REST APIs
  * Cluster APIs
  * Indices APIs
  * Document APIs
  * CAT APIs
  * Search APIs

* Action
  * Execute a cluster query.
  * Execute CAT api to check node health status.
  * Put a data.

## Video 3 - Query DSL and Mapping

* Target
  * DSL query
  * Mapping in ElasticSearch
  * Hands on demonstration on DSL Query and Mapping

* Query DSL
  * Query DSL is a JSON-style domain-specific langauge that can be used to execute queries in ElasticSearch
  * Structure of query clause

  ```json
  {
      QUERY_NAME: {
          FIELD_NAME: {
              ARGUMENT: VALUE,
              ARGUMENT: VALUE, ...
          }
      }
  }
  ```

* Query Versus Filters
  * Query
    * Relevance
    * Full text search
    * Not cacheable
    * Slow compared to Filter query
  * Filters
    * Boolean
    * Exact value match
    * Cacheable in ElasticSearch
    * Better performance

* Type of clauses
  * Leaf query clauses
  * Compound query clauses

* Types of Queries
  * Full text queries
  * Term level queries
  * Compound queries
  * Joining queries
  * Geo queries
  * Specialized queries
  * Span queries

* Action
  * Execute a DSL query
  * Create a mapping follow demo movies data.
  * Put a movie data (or document) to ElasticSearch
    * And get two errors at put action.
    * The first error about date type convert.
    * The second error about numberic type convert.
