* Use cases of Elastic Stack
  * Search
  * Suggestions
  * Log Analysis
    * Issue debugging
    * Security analysis
    * Performance analysis
    * Predictive analysis

## Video 4 - Installing and Starting ElasticSearch

* Page 1
  * Prerequistes for installing ElasticSearch
  * How to install ElasticSearch
  * Testing the installation of ElasticSearch

* Page 2
  * Prerequisites
    * Windows PC with 2GB RAM
    * Lastest version of Oracle JDK
  * Installation Package
    * [Link](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
    * Jedi: 老版本似乎还不好找

* Jedi: 为毛是印度口音，疯了我
* Jedi: 这个文档是在ElasticSearch 5.1.1版本上进行的演示，下载的是ZIP版本
* open **ElasticSearch Direcotry**\config\elasticsearch.yml
  * Uncomment cluster.name line.
  * Set cluster.name value from 'cluster.name: my-application' to 'cluster.name: Packt'.
  * Uncomment node.name line.
  * Set node.name value from 'node-1' to 'Packtnode'.

* Jedi: 视频中对应版本的[下载地址](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-5-1-1)
* Jedi: 视频中没有变更ElasticSearch的端口号
* Jedi: 在我的电脑上安装的是6.0.1版本的ElasticSearch, elasticsearch.yml的配置信息如下

```yml
bootstrap.memory_lock: false
cluster.name: elasticsearch
http.port: 9200
node.data: true
node.ingest: true
node.master: true
node.name: MIS-F3216338
path.data: D:\server\elasticsearch\6.0.1\data
path.logs: D:\server\elasticsearch\6.0.1\logs
transport.tcp.port: 9300
```

* Jedi: 注意这些配置，多少和视频中显示的不同
* Jedi: http.port可以变更服务端口号
* Notice: 即使注销掉elasticsearch.yml中的http.port配置，其默认的端口依旧是9200
* Notice: 但在执行时会有一堆报错信息(Java Exception)

* Jedi: 在视频中该版本有若干个可执行文件
  * elasticsearch-service.bat，应该是以服务的方式执行ES

* CMD Action
  * cd ElasticSearchDir\bin
  * elasticsearch-service.bat install
    * response like
    * Installing service: "elasticsearch-service-x64"
    * Using JAVA_Home (64-bit): "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_102"
    * The service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' has been installed
    * elasticsearch-service.bat start
    * open [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200) will get a json information

* Jedi: 注意在Windows平台上是用bat来安装、删除服务，而不是那个exe文件。如下所示

```bat
D:\server\elasticsearch\elasticsearch-5.1.1\bin>elasticsearch-service.bat install
Installing service      :  "elasticsearch-service-x64"
Using JAVA_HOME (64-bit):  "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.2"
The service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' has been installed.
```

## Video 5 - Installing and Starting Logstash and Kibana

* Page 1
  * Prerequisites for installing Logstash and Kibana
  * Installation procedure for Logstash and Kibana
  * Testing the installation

* Page 2
  * Prerequisites
    * NSSM - The Non-Sucking Service Manager
  * Install Package
    * [nssm](https://nssm.cc/download)
    * [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash)
    * [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana)

* Jedi: 各个版本还要看下后面的视频
* Jedi: 视频使用的版本是Logstash 5.1.2
  * Jedi: [检索地址](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases#logstash)
  * Jedi: [Logstash 5.1.1](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases/logstash-5-1-2)
* Jedi: 视频使用的版本是Kibana 5.1.2
  * Jedi: [检索地址](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases#kibana)
  * Jedi: [Kibana 5.1.2](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/past-releases/kibana-5-1-2)
* Jedi: NSSM下载回来居然被Norton给杀掉了(x64版本的)

* Action config Logstash
  * Open logstash-5.1.1\bin\LogstashPipeLine.conf，要配置管道
  * 示例如下, 这个设置感觉真是怪异
  * logstash -f LogstashPipeLine.conf --config.test_and_exit
  * Jedi: 操作系统找不到log4j, 这应该是5.1.1的一个Bug
  * Jedi: 看作者似乎是要修改setup.bat
  * 打开logstash\bin\setup.bat
  * 在最好增加log4j2的配置项
  * ```set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dlog4j.configurationFile=%LS_HOME%\config\log4j2.properties```
  * 再次执行logstash -f LogstashPipeLine.conf --config.test_and_exit，获得成功信息

```conf

input
{
    file
    {
        path => "C:\Users\Karthik.selvaraj\Downloads\ELK\Input\logstash-Input.log"
        start_position => "beginning"
    }
}
out
{
    file
    {
        path => "C:\Users\Karthik.selvaraj\Downloads\ELK\Onput\logstash-Onput.log"
    }
}
```

* Action for nssm
  * open a cmd windows ant enter into nssm instal directory
  * execute 'nssm install Logstash'
  * config parameters
    * Path: full path of logstash.bat (Jedi-as your wish)
    * Starup directory: Jedi-as your wish
    * Arguments: -f LogstashPipeLine.conf, Jedi: 指定管道配置文件
  * Jedi: 注意作者选择的是logstash.bat
  * Jedi: 这个软件对用来做实验是有效的，但在生产环境是不会用windows做服务器操作系统的

* Action for install logstash error
  * Jedi: 根据社区反馈是JDK10已取消UseParNewGC，用JDK9就没有问题。
  * Jedi: 显然需要试一下JDK9、JDK8

```bat
D:\server\logstash-5.1.1\bin>logstash -f LogstashPipeLine.conf --config.test_and_exit
Unrecognized VM option 'UseParNewGC'
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```
