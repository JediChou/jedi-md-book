## about this book

* How this book is organized: a roadmap. 2018-9-27 17:30
  * Chapter 1 introduces .NET Core and .NET Standard—what they’re for and why you should learn them.
  * Chapter 2 gets you started creating .NET Core applications.
  * Chapter 3 explores the MSBuild build system and how to edit project files.
  * Chapter 4 covers unit testing with xUnit. xUnit documentation online tends to be scattered, so this chapter will be useful as a reference later on.
  * Chapter 5 introduces working with relational databases, a common thing for developers to do. .NET Framework developers familiar with relational databases may want to move on to chapter 6.
  * Chapter 6 covers object-relational mappers (ORMs). It introduces two different types of ORMs: Dapper, a micro-ORM, and Entity Framework Core, a fullfeatured ORM.
  * Chapter 7 explores building a REST endpoint with ASP.NET Core, as well as how to make HTTP calls to other services.
  * Chapter 8 explores different options for debugging, from IDEs to command line.
  * Chapter 9 introduces performance testing with xUnit.Performance and profiling with PerfView.
  * Chapter 10 covers the internationalization process and how to make applications world-ready.
  * Chapter 11 looks at how to build .NET Core libraries and applications that rely on framework- or operating system–specific constructs.
  * Chapter 12 covers how to prepare your .NET Core library for release and distribution.
  * The appendixes contain specific details useful for writing .NET Core applications, such as target framework monikers and what’s in each version of the .NET Standard.
