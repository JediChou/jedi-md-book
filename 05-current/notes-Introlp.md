## Good question

```question
The Zebra Puzzle

• Here is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction puzzle.
• There are five houses, each of a different color and inhabited by men of different nationalities, with  different pets, drinks, and cigarettes.
• Given the facts to the right, who drinks water and who owns the zebra?

• the lucky strike smoker drinks orange juice.
