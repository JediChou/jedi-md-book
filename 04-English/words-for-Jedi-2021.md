* clench
  * When you clench something, you grip, press, or squeeze it. You might clench your fists when you're angry or clench your teeth when you're worried, for example.

* acid
  * In technical terms, acid is a substance that can react with a base to make a salt. In practical terms, acid is the stuff you want to keep off your hands, or any part of you, because it will eat away your skin.
  * Not all acids will eat skin away. The citric acid in oranges and other citrus fruits gives them their tasty tang. There is a hallucinogenic street drug called acid that eats away at the user’s sense of reality. Words sometimes have the qualities of acid. In acidic speech, words feel corrosive to the listener’s sensibilities. This one’s perhaps the most frequent and most destructive of all.

* abducted
  * To abduct someone is to commit the crime of kidnapping person and holding them for ransom.
  * Being abducted is one of the worst things that can happen to you. Fortunately, it's very rare. To abduct is to kidnap — to take someone against their will and imprison them. After an abduction, the abductors (kidnappers) may send a ransom note, asking for money.

* recoverable

* mariner
  * A mariner is someone who works on a boat or ship. A lobsterman who works alone on a small boat is a mariner, and so is the captain of an enormous cargo ship.
  * Mariner is a somewhat old-fashioned word for a sailor or seafarer, a person who spends most of their working life on some kind of ocean vessel. Today, you're more likely to read about mariners in an old book than to meet people who describes themselves this way. Mariner comes from the Latin word marinus, "of the sea," and its root, mare, "the sea."

* migraine, 偏頭痛
  * A migraine is a severe headache. When you get a migraine, you'll probably want to stay in bed, in a dark room, until it passes.
  * When you get a headache that's so painful that you can't work or function, you've probably got a migraine. It's usually women who get migraines, and you are either a person who gets migraines throughout your life, or you never get one at all. Migraines often come with side effects like nausea and blurred vision, and they often affect just one side of the head. The word comes from the Greek hemi-, "half" and kranion, "skull."

* countless
  * Countless means more than you could possibly count. If you have countless reasons why you love living in New York, there are so many reasons that you can't list them all.
  * Countless is a good adjective to use when you want to emphasize how endless, huge, or immeasurable something is. Your could say that smoke detectors save countless lives each year, or that your principal has tried countless times to ban soda at school, only to be outvoted by the student council over and over. The word dates from the 16th century, from the verb count, with its Old French root, conter, "add up."

* accurate, 精確的
  * Something that is accurate is exact and true. It's important to be accurate in the kitchen with your measurements and in the courtroom with your testimony.
  * The adjective accurate comes from the Latin roots ad curare, meaning "to take care," and that is precisely what you do when you make sure something is accurate. You take care to make sure it is perfectly correct: an accurate answer, an accurate headcount, an accurate assessment of the problem. By adding the Latin root in, meaning not, you can make the antonym inaccurate (not accurate).

* individuality, 個性

  * Whether it’s eating breakfast for lunch, learning Celtic step dancing, building birdhouses from popsicle sticks, showing off your shark tattoo, or speaking with an Australian accent on Tuesdays, all of these things can express your individuality, meaning what makes you unique.

  * Use the noun individuality to refer to the sum total of characteristics that make up a particular individual. Individuality consists of the good, the bad — and even the crazy — that make a person distinct. The word can be describe the state or value of being unique, like the members of a group whose individuality makes for lively discussions, or a having your car painted a special color — neon green, perhaps? — to express the owner's individuality.

* origami, 摺紙

  * Have you ever folded a square sheet of paper into the shape of a crane? That's origami, the Japanese art of paper folding.

  * Some origami is incredibly complicated and takes a long time to learn, while even small children can easily create simpler origami designs. Every piece of finished origami, whether it's a dog or an umbrella or a box, begins with a sheet of paper and specific folding techniques. Origami comes from two Japanese words, ori, "fold," and kami, "paper."

* duet, 二重奏

  * A duet is two people singing or playing musical instruments together. You and your brother might be a popular sidewalk duet with your fiddle-accordion combo.

  * If you have tickets for a musical duet, you'll be watching and listening to two performers. You can also call the composition that's written for the two of them a duet, since it has parts for two instruments. Two dancers can also perform a duet, a dance especially choreographed for a couple. Duet stems from the Italian duetto, "musical composition for two voices," from duo, or "two."

* volts

  * A volt is one of the units of electricity, a way to measure the force that makes an electrical current flow. A car battery typically measures between 12 and 14 volts.

  * Measuring electricity is complicated, but you can think of volts as the units of pressure a battery or generator exerts on a current of electricity to get it moving so it can produce power (for the electricity in your house, for example). Voltage is the overall term for this force. Both words come from the name of Alessandro Volta, the scientist who is considered by many to be the inventor of the electric battery.

* Thought

  * Thought is the process of using your mind to consider something. It can also be the product of that process: an idea or just the thing you're thinking about.

  * Thought can also refer to the organized beliefs of a period, individual, or group. If you're writing an essay about the Reformation, you'll probably want to summarize early Catholic thought regarding free will and predestination. This word can also be used to describe a personal belief or judgment you can't prove or be entirely certain of.

## 2021.1.18

* Graffiti

  * Graffiti is a word, phrase, or image painted or drawn somewhere in public, like on the side of a building or on the walls in a restroom.

  * Art or vandalism? That’s the debate about graffiti. For some people, graffiti looks ugly and damages the property where it’s left. Others consider graffiti a form of self-expression and a celebration of public spaces. The word comes from the Italian graffito, which means “a scratch,” and like a deep scratch, graffiti can be difficult to remove. It’s also difficult to spell, but remember that there are two fs and only one t and you’ll get it right every time.

* acidic

  * Something that's acidic has a sour or sharp taste. Lemonade, especially if it's light on the sugar, tastes very acidic.

  * Citrus fruits have a typically acidic flavor, and they qualify as acidic in the scientific definition of the word as well. In chemistry, something that's acidic has a low pH, as opposed to a base, which has a higher pH. Various kinds of acids and vinegar are also acidic. The word comes from acid, which originally meant "of the taste of vinegar," from the Latin word acidus, "sour or sharp."

* iguana, 大蜥蜴

  * An iguana is a big lizard with distinctive spines running down its back. If you keep an iguana as a pet, you'll want to feed it a lot of fresh vegetables.

  * Iguanas look a little intimidating, since they grow as large as six feet long to the tip of the tail and have a head that resembles a dinosaur. While pet iguanas can sometimes be somewhat aggressive, they can be tamed with enough handling. The word iguana is Spanish, and it comes from a West Indies language, Arawak, and its word for this particular kind of lizard, iwana.

* clutch
  * 英 [klʌtʃ]   美 [klʌtʃ]  
  * v.紧握;抱紧;抓紧;(因害怕或痛苦)突然抓住
  * n.(汽车等起换挡功能的)离合器踏板;(尤指发动机和排挡的)离合器;一群(人或动物);一批(物品)
  * 第三人称单数： clutches
  * 现在分词： clutching
  * 过去式： clutched
  * 过去分词： clutched

* convincing

  * When something is convincing, it makes people agree with what it claims to be true. Describe an argument as convincing if it wins you over and makes you believe in its rightness.

  * To figure out what convincing means, remember that vincere is the Latin word for "to conquer." Add on the prefix con-, meaning "with," and you get something that has the ability to conquer — whether it's doubts, disbelief, or hostility. The suffix -ing tells you that the word describes the action or result of something. The result of a convincing argument is more people who have joined your side or cause.

* Timber

  * Timber! That's the call of warning you hear before a tree falls. That's because those lumberjacks are going to use the tree to make timber, otherwise known as "lumber" or the wood used for construction.

  * Timber can actually be the trees used to make or build something, or the wood that comes from those trees, which you could also call "lumber." You might think that when a pirate yells "shiver me timbers!" he's referring to his wooden peg leg. But the timbers he's talking about are actually the boards and planks used to build the frame of a ship.

## 2021.1.19

* triangle

  * A triangle is a flat shape with three sides and three angles, like a slice of pizza, a yield sign, or the Greek letter delta. If you look carefully, you'll notice triangles all around you!

  * A triangle is a polygon, which is a closed shape like a square or a hexagon, but a triangle has only three sides. Wedges of pie and some tortilla chips are shaped like triangles. If you invite your crush to a movie and they bring a date, you have yourself a love triangle. Triangle comes from the Latin word triangulus, "three-cornered" or "having three angles," from the roots tri-, "three," and angulus, "angle or corner."

## 2021.1.20

* sentry

  * A sentry is someone who stands guard or watches against some intrusion or unwelcome activity. Your dog stands sentry over your house, but he would be more effective if he barked at strangers instead of licking their hands.

  * The noun sentry came from the French sentinelle, which has a similar meaning. It was in the 17th Century that the word was first associated with someone on a watchtower as a military guard. You could only enter the dreaded ice fortress after sneaking past the sentry posted outside. Don't let his button eyes and carrot nose fool you — he's a sharp one!

* lunar

  * The adjective lunar is used to describe something that is related to the moon. If you like astronomy, you probably enjoy lunar eclipses, when the Earth casts its shadow on the moon.

  * Lunar comes from the Latin word luna, meaning moon. The Roman goddess of the moon is called Luna (Selene in Greek mythology). There are lunar eclipses, a lunar calendar, lunar tides, and lunar orbits. Maybe you want to be the first live-in chef on a lunar space station. You can also hear lunar in the word lunatic — they used to think insanity was related to the cycles of the moon.

* Marshy

  * Marshy things are squishy, wet, and soft, like a marsh or a bog. After three days of rain, your backyard just might be too marshy to set up the volleyball net.

  * Any area of ground that's waterlogged is marshy, like the marshy shore of a river or the low-lying marshy patch in the neighborhood dog park. Unless there's a drought, swamps and bogs and wetlands are always marshy, and water-loving plants grow happily in these areas. This adjective comes from marsh, which has a Germanic root, mari, that means "sea."

* infect

  * To infect is to spread an illness to another person. If you sneeze on your friend, you may inadvertently infect her with your germs.

  * When a disease moves from person to person, it infects them. Most diseases only spread within one species, although there are some, like avian flu, that can infect both humans and other animals. Another way to infect someone is to deeply affect them with an idea or emotion: "His enthusiasm for music infects the class with excitement." The Latin root, inficere, means "to spoil or stain" and "to dip into."

* pediatrician
  
  * A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in the care of children. When a sick child goes to visit the pediatrician, often there are toys and other things to play with in the waiting room.
  
  * The word pediatrician has only been in use since the turn of the 20th century. Some people also use the word pediatrist to mean the same thing — a doctor who specializes in treating children ranging from newborn babies to adolescents. Pediatricians study pediatrics, both of which stem from a form of the Greek pais "children." The remainder of the word comes from the Greek iatros "healer."

* anti

## 2021.1.21

* pitchfork
  
  * A pitchfork is a large three-pronged tool used for gardening or farming. If you want to see an image of a pitchfork, just google an image of the famous painting "American Gothic."

  * With a pitchfork, a farmer can easily scoop beneath a pile of hay or straw, lift it, and toss it into a pile. Most pitchforks have wooden handles and metal prongs, and they've been around since the Middle Ages. Back then, they were sometimes used as a weapon too. The word pitchfork comes from the "toss or throw" meaning of pitch, plus fork, from the Old English forca, "forked instrument or weapon."

* artifacts
* render, rendering

## 2021.1.22

* intersect

  * When two things intersect, they run into each other, or lie across each other. Your street might intersect with a main avenue, and your life will hopefully intersect with the lives of other interesting people.

  * In geometry, when a line intersects another line, they meet at exactly one point, and when a circle intersects a line, there are two points where they touch each other. When two streets intersect, you get an intersection, where you'll often find a stop sign or traffic signal. The Latin root of intersect is intersectus, "intersect or cut asunder," which combines inter-, "between," and secare, "to cut."

* rationality

  * Use the noun rationality to refer to the state of being sensible or having good judgment. People may question your rationality if you insist on jumping into freezing water in January and skydiving for the rest of the year.

  * The noun rationality also means the state of being agreeable to reason or being based on logic. If you have to pick a pre-school for your child, you should base your decision on rationality and not an illogical reaction, such as how many of the kids eventually go to Ivy League universities. The newer school may look better on the surface, but the older building may have better teachers, a more interesting curriculum, and be closer to your home.

* I'm going to be what I was born to be.

## 2021.1.25

* peeved
  * 英 [piːvd]   美 [piːvd]  
  * adj.恼怒的;生气的

* stomp

  * When you stomp, you thud your feet down heavily as you walk. An angry teenager might stomp down the hall and slam the door to his room.

  * A little boy in big cowboy boots might stomp around the house enjoying the sound of his heels against the floor, and an awkward marching band could stomp heavily down the street playing the theme from "Rocky." You can also use the word stomp to describe a specific kind of stamping dance. This meaning has been around since about 1912, from popular jazz slang. The earlier stomp was simply a variation on the word stamp.

* horrify

  * To horrify is to cause someone to feel shocked and disturbed. It may horrify your parents if you announce that you're dropping out of school to become a professional clown.

  * Things that horrify you fill you with terror, shock, or disgust. It would horrify you to run into a vampire on a dark city streets, and it would also horrify you to be served raw hamburger for lunch. The emotion that arises when something horrifies you is horror, a word that's the same in Latin, with the literal meaning "a shaking, a trembling, or a shudder."

## 2021.1.26

* daily necessities, 基本生活必需品

* trespassing

  * Something that is trespassing is slowly intruding into where it doesn't belong. A trespassing stranger is breaking the law.

  * If you've ever seen a "No trespassing" sign, you probably know it means "Keep out!" Similarly, anything described as trespassing is creeping or otherwise moving where it doesn't belong. Trespassing kids are playing in the neighbor's lawn. A trespassing dog is getting into the chicken coop. A trespassing tree might be growing where it shouldn't be and needs to be trimmed. This word always describes people, animals, and things that go where they shouldn't. Trespassing things are invasive and encroaching.

## 2021.1.29

* could be thought of as
* entity
  * explain: something exists by itself.
  * explain: something that it is separate from other things.

* ✍ flock
  
  * The word flock refers to a group of animals, like birds or sheep, that have congregated together. The flock of pigeons at the park is so tame that they'll eat right out of your hand.
  
  * You can also use flock to mean a congregation of people, like a flock of children at the zoo, or a group of people belonging to a church. As a verb, flock means to gather together as a flock or to move together in a group. You and your friends might flock to the mall when you learn that your favorite singer will be there signing autographs.

* ✍ conjoined

  * Anything conjoined consists of more than one entity. Conjoined twins are physically connected.

  * About 200 years ago, two individuals known to the West as Chang and Eng were born in Siam (modern-day Thailand) conjoined (connected) at the sternum. Their fame gave rise to the now disused term Siamese twins, which has been replaced by conjoined twins. The somewhat infrequent verb conjoin — which provides the inspiration for the adjective conjoined — means to come together with a common purpose. You could say two people who share the same beliefs have conjoined minds.

* ✍ dorms

  * A dorm — short for dormitory — is a place where college or university students live. You'll find a lot of bunk beds in most dorms.

  * If you go away to college, you’ll probably live in a dormitory — or dorm. It's much more common for students to say dorm because it's shorter and slangier. A dorm is where students live, often with roommates. Dorms have laundry rooms and rec rooms, and it's a place where many friendships are made. Students often study or try to avoid studying in the dorm. It's their home away from home. Dorms are also called residence halls and student residences.

* ✍ verbal

  * If your friend tells you that the speech you just made was really verbal, he means you used too many words, overstated the point, went on too long, were redundant.

  * Verbal simply means, "having to do with words." If you hit someone that's a physically assault, but if you say nasty things to him, it's a verbal assault. Sometimes we use verbal to mean "spoken instead of written," usually to talk about agreements we've made. A child who is verbal is a child who can speak, and we call someone who's very articulate a verbal person.

* ✍ house around

  * When you horse around with your friends, you play in a rough and silly way, wrestling and goofing around.

  * When people horse around, they're silly and boisterous, fooling around in a physical way. Little kids horse around often, for example. The phrase doesn't immediately make sense, because you don't usually see horses playing in this way. Horse around probably comes from horseplay, and it in turn came from the old-fashioned verb horse, which was once used to mean "play crazy jokes on." Experts aren't sure how it came into use, or what horses have to do with it.

* ✍ legislating

  * Creating or enacting laws is called legislating. Everyone thinks they know how to govern a state or the country. If you are a lawmaker, you are probably tempted a million times a day to say, "Leave the legislating to people who know what they are doing!"

  * Legislating has legislate as its base word. Both words are related to legislation, which has at its roots the Latin word lex, meaning "law." If you are constantly talking to your constituents, people may begin to wonder when you have time to do the legislating that needs to be done. However, if you don't talk to your constituents, the people are sure to say you are out of touch!

* ✍ peeved, 恼怒的;生气的

* ✍ propeller

  * A propeller is a rounded blade that rotates in a circle, helping to move a vehicle by pushing against water or air. A speed boat's propeller moves it forward by spinning against the water.

  * Propellers use the laws of physics to propel, or drive forward, an aircraft or a boat. The basic structure of a propeller is a spinning or rotating shaft with wide, curved blades attached to it. The very simplest propellers were first used in ancient Greece, where the inventor Archimedes invented a "screw propeller" that moved water for irrigating crops.
