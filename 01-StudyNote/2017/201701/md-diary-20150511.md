## Linq

The Linq is a great tool for C# developer. Especially for me, I can use it to complete some operation for generic containers in the .NET.

```C#
    var tempQueryRankByProTimeSlip =
    from emp in empDict.Values.ToList()
    orderby emp.ProTimeSlip descending,
            emp.ProGroupLeader descending,
            emp.BusGroupLeader descending,
            emp.WorkId
    select emp.WorkId;
```

The code with Linq is very clear ! Somebody don't like these style, etc DaBo/ZeXin and HaiHong. I feel they make a big mistake. The Linq give us a lot of benifits. It increase code **read-ability** and **maintain-ability**, even is a computer professional graduate can quickly write C# code, like me and Ray.

I read a little books about Linq. I learn that Linq dived into three parts - Linq To Object, Linq To SQL, Linq to XML. These outdated C# features give me a lot of supprise. It is very cool!

There is Linq to SQL sample:

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

using System.Data.Linq;
using System.Data.Linq.Mapping;

namespace LinqToSQL_Sample_20150811
{
    static class HelloLinqToSql
    {
        [Table(Name = "PersonalInfo")]
        class Contact
        {
            [Column(IsPrimaryKey = true)]
            public string workid { get; set; }

            [Column(Name = "ProfitId")]
            public string ProfitId { get; set; }

            [Column(Name = "name")]
            public string name { get; set; }

            [Column(Name = "FromTaiWan")]
            public char FromTaiWan { get; set; }

            [Column(Name = "InServices")]
            public char InServices { get; set; }
        }

        static void Main()
        {
            const string dbConnectStr =
                "Data Source=10.132.160.242,3000;" +
                "User ID= legal; " +
                "Password = *****" +
                "persist security info=False;" +
                "initial catalog=MyLBPE;"; ;

            var db = new DataContext(dbConnectStr);

            var personals =
                from personal in db.GetTable<Contact>()
                select personal;

            foreach (var personal in personals.ToList())
                Console.WriteLine(personal.name);
        }
    }
}
```

At this sample, We can not write sql script and read some informations from SQL Server database. It is real cool. JiuTao Yang said it is easy than ADO.NET Entity Framework. In fact, I don't understand EF. But I belive Linq To SQL is a very quickly way to database develope with C#.

## FSharp

F# is functional language from M$. Ehh... I touch it by ***Apress Beginning F#.pdf*** from ==www.itpub.net== at two years ago. At that time I just played fsc.exe and fsi. The fsc is F# complier, fsi is F# interactive shell. And I feel it can not compare with Erlang by Ericson.

At morning today, a article catch my eye ball (F# 4.0 Released for All Platforms) at Infoq.com. The F# appeals to me is concurrent and async feature. There has a big idea, use it to create a message exchange middleware. We can use it to exchange messages, images, files and all thing from computer. I never talk about it to other, beside Ray.

Hope this desire to achive!
